# Overview

Freeact is a lightweight agent that acts by executing Python code and shell commands. Code actions are key for an agent to improve its own tool library and codebase.

Freeact has a tiny core, a small system prompt, and is extensible with agent skills. It relies on a minimal set of generic tools: read, write, execute, subagent, and tool search.

Code and shell command execution runs locally in a stateful, sandboxed environment. Freeact supports utilization of MCP servers by generating Python APIs for their tools.

Supported models

Freeact supports models compatible with [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/), with `gemini-3-flash-preview` as the current default.

## Capabilities

| Capability              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code actions**        | Freeact agents act via Python code and shell commands. This enables tool composition and intermediate result processing in a single LLM inference pass.                                                                 |
| **Local execution**     | Freeact executes code and shell commands locally in an IPython kernel provided by [ipybox](https://github.com/gradion-ai/ipybox). Data, configuration and generated tools live in local workspaces.                     |
| **Sandbox mode**        | IPython kernels optionally run in a sandbox environment based on Anthropic's [sandbox-runtime](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime). It enforces filesystem and network restrictions on OS-level. |
| **MCP code mode**       | Freeact calls MCP server tools programmatically[1](#fn:1) via generated Python APIs. This enables composition of tool calls in code actions with much lower latency.                                                    |
| **Tool discovery**      | Tools are discovered via category browsing or hybrid BM25/vector search. On-demand loading frees the context window and scales to larger tool libraries.                                                                |
| **Tool authoring**      | Agents can create new tools, enhance existing tools, or save code actions as reusable tools. This captures successful experience as executable knowledge.                                                               |
| **Agent skills**        | Skills give agents new capabilities and expertise based on [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io/). They compose naturally with code actions and agent-authored tools.                                                |
| **Subagent delegation** | Tasks can be delegated to subagents, each using their own sandbox. It enables specialization and parallelization without cluttering the main agent's context.                                                           |
| **Action approval**     | Fine-grained approval of code actions and (programmatic) tool calls from both main agents and subagents. Enables human control over potentially risky actions.                                                          |
| **Session persistence** | Freeact persists agent state incrementally. Persisted sessions can be resumed and serve as a record for debugging, evaluation, and improvement.                                                                         |
