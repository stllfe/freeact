> Freeact code action agent

Freeact is a lightweight agent that acts by executing Python code and shell commands.
Code actions are key for an agent to improve its own tool library and codebase.

Freeact has a tiny core, a small system prompt, and is extensible with agent skills.
It relies on a minimal set of generic tools: read, write, execute, subagent, and tool search.

Code and shell command execution runs locally in a stateful, sandboxed environment.
Freeact supports utilization of MCP servers by generating Python APIs for their tools.
