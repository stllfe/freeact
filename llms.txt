> Freeact code action agent

Freeact is a lightweight, general-purpose agent that acts via code actions rather than JSON tool calls.
It writes executable Python code that can call multiple tools programmatically, process intermediate
results, and use loops and conditionals in a single pass, which would otherwise require many inference
rounds with JSON tool calling.

Beyond executing tools, freeact can develop new tools from successful code actions, evolving its own
tool library over time. Tools are defined via Python interfaces, progressively discovered and loaded
from the agent's workspace rather than consuming context upfront. All execution happens locally in a
secure sandbox via ipybox.
